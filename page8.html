    <h2>How Communities Can Help Improve Quality Education</h2>

    <p>
        Communities play a powerful role in shaping the success of education.  
        When people in a community work together, they can create safe, supportive,  
        and resourceful environments that help children learn and grow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Community involvement strengthens schools, motivates students, and ensures that  
        education becomes everyone's shared responsibility, not just the school's.
    </p>
