    <h2>Barriers for Marginalized Learners</h2>

    <p>
        Marginalized learners include children who face discrimination or challenges because of disability,
        poverty, gender, religion, ethnicity, geography, or conflict situations. These students often struggle 
        more than others to access quality education. Many of them experience bullying, stigma, lack of proper
        support, or limited access to learning materials.
    </p>

    <p>
        Quality Education for all promotes inclusive education by ensuring that all learners—especially those who are marginalized—receive
        equal opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed. Removing these barriers is essential for creating a fair and 
        equitable education system.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Barriers for Marginalized Learners</h3>
