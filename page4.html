    <h2>Outdated Learning Environments</h2>

    <p>
        Many schools around the world still struggle with outdated learning environments. These include old or damaged 
        classrooms, broken chairs, limited teaching tools, poor ventilation, and unsafe building structures. Such 
        environments make learning uncomfortable and reduce the student's ability to focus and succeed academically.
    </p>

    <p>
        A good learning environment should be safe, clean, and equipped with modern educational tools. When students study 
        in outdated spaces, their motivation drops, teachers struggle to teach effectively, and learning performance declines.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Problems in Outdated Environments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cracked walls, leaking roofs, and unsafe classrooms</li>
        <li>Old desks and chairs that are uncomfortable or broken</li>
        <li>Limited lighting or poor ventilation</li>
        <li>No computers, projectors, or updated learning tools</li>
        <li>Crowded classrooms that make learning difficult</li>
    </ul>
