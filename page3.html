    <h2>Unequal Opportunities</h2>

    <p>
        Many students around the world do not receive the same learning opportunities due to differences in wealth,
        location, gender, disability, or cultural background. Some children attend well-equipped schools, while others
        study in overcrowded classrooms or incomplete buildings, making it difficult for them to succeed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unequal opportunities in education can lead to long-term disadvantages such as poor academic performance,
        limited job prospects, and higher chances of remaining in poverty. Quality of Education for All aims to remove these barriers and
        ensure that all learners—no matter who they are—receive quality and fair education.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Causes of Unequal Opportunities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Poor families unable to afford school supplies</li>
        <li>Rural areas lacking transportation or nearby schools</li>
        <li>Gender discrimination preventing girls from attending school</li>
        <li>Children with disabilities lacking proper support</li>
        <li>Lack of internet or digital devices for online learning</li>
    </ul>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Scholarship & Financial Support</h3>
            <p>
                Governments, NGOs, and private organizations can offer scholarships or free school supplies for
                students in need, helping them stay in school.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Accessible Schools in Rural Areas</h3>
            <p>
                Building more schools in remote communities reduces long travel distances and allows children to learn
                safely and comfortably.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Inclusive Education Programs</h3>
            <p>
                Schools can provide special support for students with disabilities, including ramps, tutors, and
                learning materials designed for their needs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Digital Learning Access</h3>
            <p>
                Expanding access to internet, gadgets, and learning platforms helps students continue their education
                even during emergencies or distance learning.
