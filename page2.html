    <h2>Lack of Resources</h2>
    <p>
        One of the major challenges in achieving Quality Education is the lack of essential learning resources.
        Many schools around the world, especially in rural and low-income communities, do not have enough books,
        chairs, classrooms, computers, or internet access. This creates a huge barrier for students who want to learn
        and for teachers who want to teach effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        Without proper materials, students struggle to understand lessons, fall behind, and lose motivation.
        Addressing this challenge is important because access to resources directly affects the quality of education
        and the future of young learners.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of Missing Resources</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Insufficient textbooks or shared books</li>
        <li>Outdated computers or no technology at all</li>
        <li>Damaged classrooms, broken chairs, and poor lighting</li>
        <li>Lack of clean water and basic sanitation</li>
        <li>Shortage of teaching tools (paper, markers, visual aids)</li>
    </ul>
